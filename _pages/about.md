# MJ (Minjae) Cho

I am a **Ph.D. student** in the Department of **Aerospace Engineering** at the **University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)**. My academic journey is driven by a fascination with the intersection of high-fidelity control theory and advanced machine learning.

Currently, I serve as a **Graduate Research Assistant** within the [**Laboratory for Intelligent Robots and Agents (LIRA)**](https://tran.aerospace.illinois.edu/), where I am privileged to be advised by [**Professor Huy T. Tran**](https://tran.aerospace.illinois.edu/team/).

## 🛰️ Research Focus
My doctoral research emphasizes the development of robust and safe autonomous systems. I am particularly interested in architecting **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** algorithms that are both stable and scalable for the next generation of **AI Robotics**. Key areas of investigation include:

* **Constrained Offline RL:** Developing safety-conservative policies that learn effectively from static, real-world datasets.
* **Safety-Critical Control:** Utilizing **Control Contraction Metrics (CCM)** and intrinsic reward optimization to guarantee stability in autonomous flight.
* **High-Fidelity Simulation:** Leveraging **NVIDIA Isaac Sim** and **PyTorch** to facilitate seamless sim-to-real transitions.

## 📢 Recent News
* **AIAA AVIATION 2026:** I will be presenting our paper, *"Sparsity-based safety conservatism for constrained offline reinforcement learning,"* at the **AIAA AVIATION Forum** in June 2026.
* **Mathematics 2025:** My work on *"Out of Distribution Adaptation in Offline RL via Causal Normalizing Flows"* is published in the journal **Mathematics: Statistics and Operational Research**!
* **AAAI 2024:** My work on *"Constrained meta-reinforcement learning for adaptable safety guarantee with differentiable convex programming,"* is published in the **Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence**!
