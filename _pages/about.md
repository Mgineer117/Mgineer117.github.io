I am a **Ph.D. student** in the Department of **Aerospace Engineering** at the **University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)**. Currently, I serve as a **Graduate Research Assistant** within the [**Laboratory for Intelligent Robots and Agents (LIRA)**](https://tran.aerospace.illinois.edu/), where I am privileged to be advised by [**Professor Huy T. Tran**](https://tran.aerospace.illinois.edu/team/).
I also collaborate with [**Professor Hiroyasu Tsukamoto**](https://aerospace.illinois.edu/directory/profile/hiroyasu) and his [**N-AXCIS Laboratory**](https://hirotsukamoto.com/).

## <span style="color: #13294B;">🔬 Research Interests</span>

* **Core Mission:** Deploying robust, autonomous AI-based robots in complex physical environments at the intersection of reinforcement learning and control theory.
* **Research Focus:** I tackle high-level planning and safety-assurance problems. These include safe RL, meta RL, sparse-reward RL, and safety certification of path-tracking problems.


## 📢 Recent News
* **AIAA AVIATION 2026:** I will be presenting our paper, *"Sparsity-based safety conservatism for constrained offline reinforcement learning,"* at the **AIAA AVIATION Forum** in June 2026.
* **Mathematics 2025:** My work on *"Out of Distribution Adaptation in Offline RL via Causal Normalizing Flows"* is published in the journal **Mathematics: Statistics and Operational Research**!
* **AAAI 2024:** My work on *"Constrained meta-reinforcement learning for adaptable safety guarantee with differentiable convex programming,"* is published in the **Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence**!
