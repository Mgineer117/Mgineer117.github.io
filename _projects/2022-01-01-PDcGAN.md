This project focuses on the intersection of computer vision and reinforcement learning. I implemented a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to navigate a quadrotor through a simulated city, processing raw camera input to make real-time flight decisions. By leveraging a surrogate policy gradient, IRPO effectively manages credit assignment in complex navigation tasks where external rewards are rare.
